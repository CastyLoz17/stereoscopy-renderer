small stereoscopy renderer using mostly vanilla stdlib python files with the exception of `pillow`, which you have to `pip install pillow` yourself. i think its optional and that features relying on it will automatically disable but i havent tested that yet and its 1:20am.
for more information, read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy. note that this is not the same as autostereography, as seen here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram.
if you need help acheiving this effect, i suggest looking at https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicEye/comments/i32l64/dont_know_how_to_view_magiceye_autostereograms/

# controls
either run the .exe in releases, or run the `renderer.py` file. note that the objects are pre-bundled in the .exe, but you need the objs for the .py version.
